# Network inference for autoregressive modelsi
## Introduction
 This repository contains codes for conducting estimation and testing for network parameters in high-dimensional autoregressive models. 
* **Hypothesis testing for high-dimensional linear AR(p) model**

The folder **linear-testing** includes R codes for conducting hypothesis testing for autoregressive parameters in high-dimensional AR(p) model. 

The testing method is proposed in the paper *Testing for high-dimensional network parameters in auto-regressive models* by Lili Zheng and Garvesh Raskutti.

* **Estimating context-dependent network from autoregressive point processes** 

The folder **context-dependent-network** includes Matlab functions for estmating context-dependent network from marked point processes, where past events associated with one node can triger/inhibit future events of its neighbors and the marks of events modulates the influences among nodes. 

The algorthms are proposed in the paper *Context-dependent self-exciting point processes: models, methods, and risk bounds in high dimensions* by Lili Zheng, Garvesh Raskutti, Rebecca Willett and Ben Mark. Real data sets and R codes for network visualization are also included.
